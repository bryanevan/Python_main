Exercise 1.4: File Handling in Python

**Learning Goals**

•	Use files to store and retrieve data in Python

**Reflection Questions:**

Why is file storage important when you’re using Python? What would happen if you didn’t store 
local files?

File storage in Python is like keeping your stuff in a virtual locker. It's important because it
lets you save data even after your program stops running. Since the data is stored on local, it
can be used for different programs. Without file storage all data would be lost after programs
are finished running.

In this Exercise you learned about the pickling process with the **pickle.dump()** method. What 
are pickles? In which situations would you choose to use pickles and why?

Pickling is taking python script and converting it into a byte stream; the inverse is “unpickling.” 
It’s a pretty effective technique for taking something like a machine learning model, exporting it 
into a binary file format, then invoking it in another program. It’s also great for compressing 
massive datasets.

In Python, what function do you use to find out which directory you’re currently in? What if you 
wanted to change your current working directory?

Current working dir - os.getcwd()

Change dir - os.chdir()

Imagine you’re working on a Python script and are worried there may be an error in a block of 
code. How would you approach the situation to prevent the entire script from terminating due to 
an error?

You could wrap the whole questionable block of code in a try-except block to partition segments 
of the block into items that can be individually assessed.

You’re now more than halfway through Achievement 1! Take a moment to reflect on your learning in 
the course so far. How is it going? What’s something you’re proud of so far? Is there something 
you’re struggling with? What do you need more practice with? Feel free to use these notes to guide 
your next mentor call.

Going well so far. I’ve always liked working with Python but it’s been a couple of years so I’m 
noticing some things I’ve forgotten in that time. The deeper I go into the coursework, the more 
my memory is coming back as well; definitely proud of that. I wouldn’t say there’s anything that’s 
a struggle at this stage, it’s just a matter of repetition and spending quality time in the 
language. I would like to practice the applications of lambda functions, I remember those came in 
pretty handy in the past but can’t remember much about them.
