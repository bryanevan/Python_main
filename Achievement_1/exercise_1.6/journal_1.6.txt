### Exercise 1.6: Connecting to Databases in Python

Learning Goals

- Create a MySQL database for your Recipe app

Reflection Questions

- What are databases and what are the advantages of using them?

Databases are simply data storage mechanisms to house, retrieve, and change data that is..stored 
there. The advantages are numerous, but primarily data persistence in a structured manner by using 
relational or non-relational methods. Another big one is security, as encryption techniques to 
restrict access to, and hide, sensitive data is always ideal. It also provides a means of backing 
up fallen systems, so long as the database remains uncorrupted. Also, databases serve as access 
points through which API are built to manage and retrieve information, such that we can built 
software that becomes useful to the end user.

- List 3 data types that can be used in MySQL and describe them briefly:

| Data type | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| INT | + or - numbers |
| VARCHAR | character length, alphanumeric |
| DATE | YYYY-MM-DD |
- In what situations would SQLite be a better choice than MySQL?

SQLite is best for projects that need to prioritize simplicity and low volume transaction rates, 
local storage. It operates entirely within the application (serverless) so it’s pretty useful for 
testing or learning purposes. 

- Think back to what you learned in the Immersion course. What do you think about the differences 
between JavaScript and Python as programming languages?

The biggest difference that stands out to me is JS was built, and is maintained, for web dev; where 
python seems to have a higher variance of use cases. Over the last 8 years or so Python has become 
very popular in data science, machine learning, automation, and data analysis, given Python’s myriad 
of libraries that pertain to that domain. Python crosses into web dev domain via Django and Flask, 
primarily, but it doesn’t have anywhere near the same marketshare as JS for client-side. Python 
always stands out as a more readable language, given its more simplistic syntax and lower learning 
curve.

- Now that you’re nearly at the end of Achievement 1, consider what you know about Python so far. 
What would you say are the limitations of Python as a programming language?

Just from what I’ve experienced in working with Python in past jobs, it’s incredibly useful for a
data science and analytics application because it has pretty powerful libraries to draw from: 
NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and supporting environments like JupyterNotebook and 
JupyterLab; however, I haven’t seen much of it on client-side due to a lack in variance of 
libraries and frameworks for client-side applications. Maybe the biggest factor is that Python isn’t 
inherently designed for web browsers, so Python requires a fair bit of support from additional tools 
just to operate to expectations, which will add complexity.
